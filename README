Math-Recaman

Recamán's sequence is a well known sequence defined by a recurrence relation.

It is named after its inventor, Colombian mathematician Bernado Recamán Santos by Nel Sloane,
creator of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The OEIS entry for this sequence is A005132.

The sequence is defined as

  An = 0 if n = 0
  An = An-1 - n if An-1 - n > 0 and is not already in the sequence
  An = An-1 + n otherwise

It is known to produce quite aethetically pleasing outputs if plotted as an image or as music.

This module includes both a function for generating the sequence but also a command line tool for printing it out
but also for generating images and sound files of the sequence.
